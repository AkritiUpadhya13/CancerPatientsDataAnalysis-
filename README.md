# Cancer Patients Data Analysis : Classifiers
It's a challenge to decide that which model will predict the best. I chose Cancer Patients Dataset from Kaggle to classify that what are the factors that will decide the level of cancer in patients. As there are many efficient classification algorithms, but which classifier will give me the best prediction.

In search of this answer, I compared 9 classification algorithms, and the answer was, Radius Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier.

However the 9 algorithms that are used here are :

1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent
5. Support Vector Classifier
6. Radius Neighbors Classifier
7. Naive Bayes
8. Decision Tree Classifier
9. Random Forest Classifier
